# TDD Practice

Here are some challenging projects I've worked on to level up my skills as a software engineer while following good practices. Although the projects are simple in code, they are complex in understanding. I believe that's how we learn the most. It's not about the number of lines of code, but about the depth of the problem and how simply you can express a solution for it.

It takes a long time to put every project together, and of course I have other things to do, so this is an ongoing process and I don't know how often I can add a new project, but I hope these projects help others to gain knowledge and improve their craft as software engineers.
